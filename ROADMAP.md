# Roadmap
This is the roadmap of future Project Tracker releases. The features here are categorized
into *major releases*. In short, these are huge updates with many new features. However, to
get the newest features out as quickly as possible to enpower developers right away, often
smaller releases are made (such as v1.2, v1.5, etc.) that contain a few of the features
of thoese larger releases.
