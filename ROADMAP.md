# Roadmap
This is the roadmap of future Project Tracker releases. If you're interested in trying
out pre-release builds, there currently aren't any available. Please check the [releases](https://github.com/CyanCoding/Project-Tracker/releases) tab for the latest release. The future releases here are major
releases. You'll see things like v1.0 and v2.0 here, but often minor releases
will be made such as v1.2 to fix a few things or add a new feature.
