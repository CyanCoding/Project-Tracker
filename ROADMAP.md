# Roadmap
This is the roadmap of future Project Tracker releases. If you're interested in trying
out pre-release builds, those can be found here! Pre-releases are designed to solve
just a few bugs/implement a few new features at a time. They're probably **not** bug-free. 
Each pre-release contains all of the checked off items in the future releases area.
Once **all** of the items are checked off, the program will be built into an official
release.

Pre-release builds must be downloaded from this document. At the current time,
your Project Tracker program will only update for releases. To install a
pre-release, please uninstall your current installation of the Project Tracker
and download one of these.

## Latest official release (v1.0):
**Estimated release date:** `May 5th, 2020`

⚠ The first official release has not been created yet
as this program is still in beta! ⚠

## Latest pre-release (v0.6):
**Release date:** `April 30th, 2020`

Download the installer [here](https://github.com/CyanCoding/Project-Tracker/raw/master/install-resources/Project%20Tracker%20Installer.exe).

This pre-release didn't change much, but now we have an installer rather than a `.zip`!
The only other changed thing is that it fixed the window-hiding bug when you updated.
