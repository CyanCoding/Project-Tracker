# Roadmap
This is the roadmap of future Project Tracker releases. If you're interested in trying
out pre-release builds, those can be found [here](https://github.com/CyanCoding/Project-Tracker/releases)!
Pre-releases are designed to solve just a few bugs/implement a few new features at a time.
They're probably **not** bug-free. Each pre-release contains all of the checked off items
in the future releases area. Once **all** of the items are checked off, the program will
be built into an official release.
