# Roadmap
This is the roadmap of future Project Tracker releases. If you're interested in trying
out pre-release builds, the latest one can be found [here](https://github.com/CyanCoding/Project-Tracker/releases/tag/v0.6)!
Pre-releases are designed to solve just a few bugs/implement a few new features at a time.
They're probably **not** bug-free. Each pre-release contains all of the checked off items
in the future releases area. Once **all** of the items are checked off, the program will
be built into an official release. At the moment, there is no official release. When an 
official release is created, it will be linked here.

## Future releases:
Note: estimated release dates are **estimated**. Based on how quickly the project is progressing,
these may change. It's not uncommon for a project to be finished ahead of schedule. When the
project gets close to the estimated release date, either an updated estimate or an official
date will be posted allowing you to stay up to date with when new updates will be available.
