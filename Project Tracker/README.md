# Project Tracker
This software is designed to allow programmers to track all
of their coding projects in one place. With the Project Tracker, 
you can easily view each project's errors, feature suggestions, 
comments, time spent on the project, and percent complete!

# Version: 0.6 (beta)
Currently this project is still in beta. If you want to try
the project out, there is an installable version located
at the [releases](https://github.com/CyanCoding/Project-Tracker/releases) 
for Windows 8/10 systems.
As this program is still in beta, it does **not** have full 
functionality and it's probably littered with bugs. If you 
encounter anything, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/CyanCoding/Project-Tracker/issues) 
or consider helping to solve the problem. Thanks!
