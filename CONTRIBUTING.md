**Before contributing**, make sure you're familiar with the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/CyanCoding/Project-Tracker/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How can I contribute?
You can contribute by coding backend/frontend, submitting a bug report, or submitting a feature request.

### Submitting a bug report
Noticed something off about the Project Tracker? Submit a bug report at
[issues](https://github.com/CyanCoding/Project-Tracker/issues). Before
reporting a bug, make sure that you can recreate it. Instead of creating
a broad and hard-to-fix issue like "Project Tracker crashes", try and find
what's going wrong and what leads up to it, such as "Project Tracker crashes
directly after installation". All bug reports should be tagged with the 
`bug` tag.

If you are intending to fix the bug, go ahead and read Backend contribution 
**and** Frontend contribution. Even if you're only intending to code backend
or frontend, it's important that you know what is required of any kind of
code contribution. When you create the issue, **make sure to assign yourself**. 
Any issue left unassigned will typically be assigned to the owner, [@CyanCoding](https://github.com/CyanCoding).

### Submitting a feature request
Have an idea about an improvement to the Project Tracker? Create an 
[issues](https://github.com/CyanCoding/Project-Tracker/issues)!
All feature requests should be tagged with the `enhancement` tag.


If you are intending to implement the feature, go ahead and read Backend contribution 
**and** Frontend contribution. Even if you're only intending to code backend
or frontend, it's important that you know what is required of any kind of
code contribution. When you create the issue, **make sure to assign yourself**. 
Any issue left unassigned will typically be assigned to the owner, [@CyanCoding](https://github.com/CyanCoding).

### Backend contribution
You're interested in coding part of the Project Tracker? You're in the right
starting place. The Project Tracker is a [WPF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/)
`C#` project and all backend code is written in `C#`. All backend files
can be recognized by the `*.cs` extension.
Head over to the [issues](https://github.com/CyanCoding/Project-Tracker/issues)
and find something that you would like to work on and assign yourself.
Please only work on **one** issue at a time. 
When you finish coding, submit your pull request and it will be reviewed.

### Frontend contribution
A frontend contribution changes the styling and/or design of the Project Tracker.
Frontend files can be recognized by the `*.xaml` extension. If you want to change
the design of the Project Tracker, please submit a pull request and state
how your contribution improves upon the overall layout **and** display
of the program.

To avoid any unwanted results, it's **heavily** advised that you make sure
any `C#` files related to the display you're changing don't interfere
with your design. Many components of the display are changed in the
`*.xaml.cs` files and you may need to change the respective `C#` file as well.
