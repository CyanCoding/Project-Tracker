The Project Tracker is a productivity and organizational software application aimed towards empowering developers and helping them efficiently manage all of their projects. Quickly start a new project, set the project language, and get coding! The Project Tracker will handle all of your tasks in a to-do fashion categorized by error, feature, and comment categories.

However, the Project Tracker brings more to the table than just a to-do list. Set the project icon, see project progress, automatically count lines of code, or even access your project's directory with the one-click shortcut! The Project Tracker simplifies development life, enabling you to do what you do best, code, faster and more efficiently than ever.
