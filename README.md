## Latest version:
### v0.6:
Currently this project is still in beta. If you want to try it out, 
you can find it at the [releases](https://github.com/CyanCoding/Project-Tracker/releases/tag/v0.6).
As this program is still in beta, it does **not** have full functionality.
If you encounter any issues, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/CyanCoding/Project-Tracker/issues) 
or consider helping to solve the problem. Before you do that, however,
make sure there isn't already an issue similar to yours. For the most
part, all of the bugs and lack of features in the pre-release are already
submitted and will be fixed before the official release.

Head over to the [roadmap](https://github.com/CyanCoding/Project-Tracker/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)
