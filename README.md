# Project Tracker
With the Project Tracker, easily **create**, **manage**, **track**, and **develop** all of your
programming projects. At the heart of the Project Tracker is a *simple* to-do list.
Create tasks for each project, categorized by three simple criteria (error, feature, 
or comment). You'll be able to manage all of your development tasks and to-do's better
with Project Tracker's *blazingly* fast features and intuitive design created for developers. Coming soon
are more features designed to help you develop faster and more efficiently like
automatic lines of code counting, offline GitHub project integration, easy access
to your project's folders and files with the click of a button, and more!
