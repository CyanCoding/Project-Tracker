# Project Tracker
With the Project Tracker, easily **create**, **manage**, **track**, and **develop** all of your
programming projects. At the heart of the Project Tracker is a *simple* to-do list.
Create tasks for each project, categorized by three simple criteria (error, feature, 
or comment). You'll be able to manage all of your development tasks and to-do's better
with Project Tracker's *blazingly* fast features and intuitive design created for developers.


Some of these features include **automatic code counting** and **folder integration**. Code counting
means you can keep track of the length of your project and how much coding you've done on it. 
Folder integration means never again will you have to navigate endlessly through File Explorer 
looking for your project! With the click of a button, navigate to your project's folder. 

Coming soon are more features designed to help you develop faster and more efficiently like
offline GitHub project integration, project searching, and more!
